How do you determine the number of threads you should launch to realistically test your application?

To do this, first disable mutexes in your code. Then repeatedly test with an increasing number of threads.
Once you have reached a number of threads such that interrupts are reliably causing issues, restore the mutexes.
If the same number of threads can be run without any issues once the mutexes are restored, the code is functional.

If you are launching several threads, under what circumstances would these threads not run in parallel on a modern processor?

They will not run in parallel if the number of threads being run is greater than twice the number of cores in your CPU.
This is because modern processors divide their cores into two CPUs (hyperthreading).
For example, a four-core CPU can run at most 8 threads at once, so if there are 9 or more threads they will not run in parallel.
